    <p>I designed the UX and UI for the vehicle allocation chart below by ascertaining the strengths and weaknesses of the existing product and consulted current customers directly to find out which parts were liked and disliked. I compared this qualitative feedback with system analytics to see which areas of the system were most and least used. I have detailed the UX process below and repeated user tests on-site and remotely.</p>
